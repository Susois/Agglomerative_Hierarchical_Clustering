# AHC Simulator

This project simulates the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm, allowing users to input data points on a coordinate system. The application visually demonstrates the clustering process by highlighting and merging points step by step.

```

## Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application by executing the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Input your data points in the provided fields.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate the clustering process.
4. Observe the step-by-step merging of points on the coordinate system.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting data points.
- Visual representation of the clustering process.
- Step-by-step merging of clusters for better understanding.
